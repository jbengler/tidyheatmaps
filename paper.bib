abstract = {{While transcripts of neuronal mitochondrial genes are strongly suppressed in central nervous system inflammation, it is unknown whether this results in mitochondrial dysfunction and whether an increase of mitochondrial function can rescue neurodegeneration. Here we show that predominantly genes of the electron transport chain are suppressed in inflamed mouse neurons resulting in impaired mitochondrial complex IV activity. This was associated with posttranslational inactivation of the transcriptional co-regulator PGC-1α. In mice, neuronal overexpression of Ppargc1a, which encodes for PGC-1α, led to increased numbers of mitochondria, complex IV activity and maximum respiratory capacity. Moreover, Ppargc1a overexpressing neurons showed a higher mitochondrial membrane potential that related to an improved calcium buffering capacity. Accordingly, neuronal deletion of Ppargc1a aggravated neurodegeneration during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), while neuronal overexpression of Ppargc1a ameliorated it. Our study provides systemic insights into mitochondrial dysfunction in neurons during inflammation and commends elevation of mitochondrial activity as a promising neuroprotective strategy.}},

abstract = {{Neuroinflammation causes neuronal injury in multiple sclerosis (MS) and other neurological diseases. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important modulators of neuronal stress responses, but knowledge about their contribution to neuronal protection or damage during inflammation is limited. Here, we constructed a regulatory miRNA–mRNA network of inflamed motor neurons by leveraging cell type–specific miRNA and mRNA sequencing of mice undergoing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We found robust induction of miR-92a in inflamed spinal cord neurons and identified cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein 3 (Cpeb3) as a key target of miR-92a–mediated posttranscriptional silencing. We detected CPEB3 repression in inflamed neurons in murine EAE and human MS. Moreover, both miR-92a delivery and Cpeb3 deletion protected neuronal cultures against excitotoxicity. Supporting a detrimental effect of Cpeb3 in vivo, neuron-specific deletion in conditional Cpeb3 knockout animals led to reduced inflammation-induced clinical disability in EAE. Together, we identified a neuroprotective miR-92a–Cpeb3 axis in neuroinflammation that might serve as potential treatment target to limit inflammation-induced neuronal damage.}},

abstract = {{Disease activity of autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis and its mouse model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is temporarily suppressed by pregnancy. However, whether disease amelioration is due to nonspecific immunomodulation or mediated by Ag-specific regulation of disease-causing conventional T cells (Tcon) and immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) remains elusive. In the current study, we systematically analyzed changes of the TCRβ repertoire driven by EAE and pregnancy using TCR sequencing. We demonstrate that EAE, but not pregnancy, robustly increased TCR repertoire clonality in both peripheral Tcon and Treg. Notably, pregnancy was required for the expansion of Treg harboring the dominant EAE-associated TRBV13-2 chain and increased the frequency of EAE-associated clonotypes within the Treg compartment. Our findings indicate that pregnancy supports the expansion of Treg clonotypes that are equipped to recognize EAE-associated Ags. These Treg are thereby particularly suited to control corresponding encephalitogenic Tcon responses and likely contribute to pregnancy-associated protection in autoimmunity.}},
